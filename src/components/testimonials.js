                        <p>Kelly and Donald are such amazing people. It's like they were both intentional about pouring
                            all they knew into us, they
                            are both so positive, funny and full of life. It was such an impactful moment. I did learn
                            that in as much as it is
                            important to have coaches and mentors in the voiceover field, you can be authentic and
                            original as well without
                            necessarily imitating anyone. You also have to constantly give value. And never forget to
                            take care of your health. Plus
                            a couple of other things you would have learnt if you had been there😉

                        <p>My 3 months training on VO with kickstart into vos has been amazing. I was able to learn how
                            to use my voice well, know
                            my range and how best to use it. Also,the training has shaped me in being confident with
                            myself and channeled me to the
                            right genre that best suits my voice and business wise. Kickstart into vos is a place to be,
                            if you really want to
                            kickstart your journey as a voiceover artist. They have got great facilitators who are
                            passionate about what they do by
                            sharing their knowledge to students willing to learn. Thank you Rita Ekeagu

                        <p>I would like to appreciate the entire Kickstart Into VOs team for their efforts in making us
                            learn so much in this
                            time. I have been able to understand how to read and interpret different genres of scripts
                            and also voice them
                            appropriately. This class has also improved my confidence in the gift that God has given me
                            and exposed me to the
                            industry.<br />I hope the lessons I have learned will be evident in my future productions and
                            do
                            the academy proud! Thanks
                            again. God bless!
